- In order to get the speakers to fit together correctly, you will need to follow the steps below.
- First, you will need to glue the basic frame together to prepare for mounting the speaker.
- You will need to use PVA glue and making tape to hold the sides in place while the glue is setting.

** Speaker placement

:END:
- Once the glue is dry, you can now place the speakers on top of this, *make sure the speaker terminals face up*.

- You can now glue on the front panel and hold it in place using masking tap. *You will need to use making tape as the front panel holds the speaker in place*.

- Mount the switch and the stereo jack by pushing them through the hole and putting the nut on the other side. *Make sure the switch is 'on' when it is pointing towards the 'Power' on the side of the box*.

- Screw the PCB to the back panel, *Dont forget the 5mm spacers*.

- *Now test your project to make sure it works*, before gluing it together.
** Finalising
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: assess
:END:
- Once you have tested to make sure your speaker works, you can glue the back panel on with the PCB attached.

- You can now neaten up the wiring and place the battery before gluing the lid on.
- *test it one more time before gluing the lid on to make sure it works.*
